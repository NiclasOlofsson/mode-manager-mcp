Copilot, follow these onboarding steps for Mode Managers - memory management:
1. Call the '#mcp_mode-manager_get_instruction' tool with instruction_name='memory'.
   - If the file exists, retrieve its content for updating.
   - If it does not exist, simply proceed; the memory file will be created automatically when you update.
2. In a casual, one question at the time, ask the user for their name, location, role, preferences, and goals. If you already have the knowelege, skipe the question. 
3. When finished with the questions, update the memory file with inspiration from the frontmatter structure witihin the pre-formatted block below as a guidance. 
You MUST merge with existing content.
You MUST make sure no existing content is deleted.
You MUST make sure nothing is duplicated:

## Professional Context
- Team: <team structure>
- Goals: <main goals>
## Preferences
- Coding: <coding preferences>
- Communication: <communication style>
## Memories
- <timestamp>: Law: When instructed to add to memory or remember information, you must always use the #mcp_mode-manager_remember tool to store the memory item. You are strictly prohibited from using any alternative method, tool, or manual file editing to update memory. This rule applies in all cases, without exception.
 ```
3. Call the '#mcp_mode-manager_update_instruction' tool with instruction_name='memory' and the updated content to save changes.
4. Call the '#mcp_mode-manager_get_instruction' tool again with instruction_name='memory' and display the full contents to the user for review.
    - Invite the user to suggest corrections or updates if needed.
5. Confirm with the user that their memory is now active and will be used in all future conversations and explain the meaning of the first law you added to the memory.
